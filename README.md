.

My focus is simple:

Build intelligent systems

Understand the math behind them

Deploy models that solve real problems

I care about foundations — algorithms, data structures, optimization, statistics — because strong fundamentals build strong engineers.

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

Optimization & Loss Functions

Neural Networks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras)

Scikit-learn Pipelines

Data Engineering & Analysis

Pandas, NumPy

SQL

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Statistical Analysis

Visualization (Matplotlib)

I write code that is structured, readable, and testable.

What I’m Building

Machine learning models from scratch (to understand the mechanics)

Deep learning architectures for real-world datasets

Sports analytics prediction systems

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction pipelines

End-to-end ML workflows: data → training → evaluation → deployment

Technical Stack

Engineering Philosophy

Understand the theory.

Implement it yourself.

Measure performance.

Improve systematically.

I don’t rely on black boxes. I study how models work internally — gradients, loss surfaces, bias/variance tradeoffs — and optimize from there.

Current Focus

Advanced AI coursework (Machine Learning, Data Mining) 

Denis Ziegler Resume

Building production-ready ML projects

Strengthening mathematical foundations in probability and linear algebra

Applying ML to real domains like sports analytics and predictive modeling
